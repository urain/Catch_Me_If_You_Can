Demonstrating some cool things you can do with VBA inside Word Documents:
1. The ability to directly call exported APIs from Windows DLLs.
2. The ability to dynamically allocate RWX memory and copy/execute data.
3. The ability to dynamically assign a function to raw bytes and execute.
4. The ability to implement custom deobfuscation/decoding from Word Document Headers.
5. The ability to write deobfuscated/decoded data to disk and launch EXEs.
